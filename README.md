# Little Acorn

is a short game about a cute squirrel building a shelter and
collects acorns for the winter during the peak of fall.
The shopkeeper helps them along the way, *though what does he do?*
This is my first 3D (Godot) game and I had a lot of fun making it!

## How to play

The movement is pretty simple. You can only move with <kbd>wasd</kbd>,
interact with <kbd>e</kbd>/<kbd>spacebar</kbd>, and pause the game with <kbd>esc</kbd>.
There are five short days in total and for each of them,
you get 90 seconds to collect as many acorns and logs for your fire as possible.


You must retrieve and deposit them at your home before the timer runs out,
otherwise your items for the day will be voided. Have fun playing!
(Also the pumpkin gods made it rain pumpkins, so be careful of them!!)

## Note for stonemasons/reviewers

I sent a heartbeat in VSCode while writing my commit message, so
Hackatime thinks "little-acorn" & "Little Acorn" are two projects (The time is not duplicated)
